Rinstall
========

This program will only work on linux or mac. The main script install.py will download and install [R](http://cran.r-project.org) from source as well as download and install [OpenBlas](http://xianyi.github.com/OpenBLAS) from source. OpenBlas is an optimized BLAS library based on GotoBLAS2 that makes matrix operations in R run much faster and in parallel if you have a multicore system.
